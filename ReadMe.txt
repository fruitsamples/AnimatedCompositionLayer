Quartz Composer Application

AnimatedCompositionLayer		A basic application that demonstrates how to animate 
					composition input parameters on a Core Animation composition 
					layer through transactions.

Sample Requirements			The project was created using the Xcode running under 
					Mac OS X 10.6.x or later. The supplied Quartz Composer 
					compositions were created using the Quartz Composer editor 
					running under Mac OS X 10.6.x or later.

About the sample			The sample uses a Quartz Composer composition that generates 
					multiple circles. The composition is set up as a Core Animation 
					layer.  As the user presses a mouse button, the Core Animation 
					generates new colors and sizes for the circles. These values 
					are used as the new input parameters for the composition, and 
					the user will see the changed sizes and colors of the circles.

Using the Sample			Open the project using the Xcode editor which can be found 
					in /Developer/Applications. Build the project and run. Press 
					the mouse button to change the size and color of the circles.
